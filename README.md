# Project 1 Generative Text

Chandhini Grandhi, cgrandhi@ucsd.edu


## Abstract

The project I will be working on is  to generate TV scripts for the popular 90s sitcom - FRIENDS. I am a huge fan of the TV series and have watched all 10 seasons multiple times. In this project, I am going to build a 2 layer RNN which can be trained to generate a new script for the series (Hopefully, it will be released as Season 11). The dataset I am going to use is 100,000 line FRIENDS Transcript obtained from https://fangj.github.io/friends/ . The data has to be processed and  tokenized to be represented as a bag of words. The processed data will then be fed to a 2-layer neural network implemented in Pytorch. I plan to experiment with it by changing the number of training epochs, Embedding dimensions and Batch size. 


## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
